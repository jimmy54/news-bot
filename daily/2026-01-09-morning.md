- **Mastering the Game of Go with Self-play Experience Replay**  
  来源：arXiv cs.AI (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.03306v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The game of Go has long served as a benchmark for artificial intelligence, demanding sophisticated strategic reasoning and long-term planning. Previous approaches such as AlphaGo and its successors, have predominantly relied on model-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In this work, we present QZero, a novel model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that forgoes search during training and learns a Nash equilibrium policy through self-play and...

- **Digital Red Queen: Adversarial Program Evolution in Core War with LLMs**  
  来源：arXiv cs.AI (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.03335v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embrace...

  来源：arXiv cs.LG (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.03315v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We report a case study of four end-to-end attempts to autonomously generate ML research papers using a pipeline of six LLM agents mapped to stages of the scientific workflow. Of these four, three attempts failed during implementation or evaluation. One completed the pipeline and was accepted to Agents4Science 2025, an experimental inaugural venue that required AI systems as first authors, passing both human and multi-AI review. From these attempts...

  来源：arXiv cs.IR (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.03258v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples a retriever with a large language model (LLM) to ground generated responses in external evidence. While this framework enhances factuality and domain adaptability, it faces a key bottleneck: balancing retrieval recall with limited LLM context. Retrieving too few passages risks missing critical context, while retrieving too many overwhelms the prompt window, diluting relevance and increasing cost.   We p...

  来源：arXiv cs.IR (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.03259v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing sequential recommendation models, even advanced diffusion-based approaches, often struggle to capture the rich semantic intent underlying user behavior, especially for new users or long-tail items. This limitation stems from their reliance on ID-based embeddings, which lack semantic grounding. We introduce LLMDiRec, a new approach that addresses this gap by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into an intent-aware diffusion model. Our...

  来源：arXiv cs.CL (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.03261v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Deep Research agents predominantly optimize search policies to maximize retrieval probability. However, we identify a critical bottleneck: the retrieval-utilization gap, where models fail to use gold evidence even after it is retrieved, due to context blindness in noisy environments. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResearch-Slice, a simple yet effective neuro-symbolic framework. Unlike implicit attention, our approach predicts precise span indi...

  来源：arXiv cs.CL (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.03263v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models frequently exhibit sycophancy, prioritizing user agreeableness over correctness. We investigate whether this requires external regulation or can be mitigated by internal reasoning alone. Using CAP-GSM8K (N=500), an adversarial dataset, we evaluate internal (CoT) versus external (RCA) mechanisms across GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5.1. Our results reveal the structural limits of internal reasoning: it causes performance collapse i...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.03378v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Repository-level code completion benefits from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, controlling cross-file evidence is difficult because chunk utility is often interaction-dependent: some snippets help only when paired with complementary context, while others harm decoding when they conflict. We propose RepoShapley, a coalition-aware context filtering framework supervised by Shapley-style marginal contributions. Our module ChunkShapley c...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.03390v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: As Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols begin to be used in permissioned blockchains for user-facing applications such as payments, it is crucial that they provide low latency. In pursuit of low latency, some recently proposed BFT consensus protocols employ a leaderless optimistic fast path, in which clients broadcast their requests directly to replicas without first serializing requests at a leader, resulting in an end-to-end commit latency o...

A well-known limitation is that dynamically available protocols, on their own, cannot provide strong safety guarantees during network partitions or extended asynchrony. Ebb-and-flow protocols [SP21] address this by combining a dynamically available protocol with a partially synchronous finality protocol that irr...
