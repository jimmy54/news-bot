  来源：arXiv cs.AI (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.05256v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Inland water monitoring is vital for safeguarding public health and ecosystems, enabling timely interventions to mitigate risks. Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately.

  来源：arXiv cs.AI (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.05298v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge gra...

  来源：arXiv cs.LG (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.05296v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The pervasive "memory wall" bottleneck is significantly amplified in modern large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. MoE's inherent architectural sparsity leads to sparse arithmetic compute and also introduces substantial activation memory overheads -- driven by large token routing buffers and the need to materialize and buffer intermediate tensors. This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on G...

- **TIME: Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine for Context Triggered Explicit Reasoning**  
  来源：arXiv cs.LG (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.05300v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Reasoning oriented large language models often expose explicit "thinking" as long, turn-global traces at the start of every response, either always on or toggled externally at inference time. While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, trea...

Each datapoint includes a personal vote (first-order signal) and a meta-prediction of how others will vote (second-order signal), allowing richer modeling than traditional datasets that capture only individual preferences. SP-Rank contains over 12,00...

  来源：arXiv cs.CL (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.05271v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The ubiquity of payment networks generates vast transactional data encoding rich consumer and merchant behavioral patterns. Recent foundation models for transaction analysis process tabular data sequentially but rely on index-based representations for categorical merchant fields, causing substantial semantic information loss by converting rich textual data into discrete tokens. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can address this limitation through...

  来源：arXiv cs.CL (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.05358v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Public debates about "left-" or "right-wing" news overlook the fact that bias is usually conveyed by concrete linguistic manoeuvres that transcend any single political spectrum. We therefore shift the focus from where an outlet allegedly stands to how partiality is expressed in individual sentences. Drawing on 26,464 sentences collected from newsroom corpora, user submissions and our own browsing, we iteratively combine close-reading, interdiscipl...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.05385v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We present DafnyPro, an inference-time framework that enhances LLMs for generating verification annotations in Dafny. DafnyPro comprises three key components: a diff-checker that prevents modifications to base program logic, a pruner that removes unnecessary invariants, and a hint-augmentation system that retrieves and applies predefined, problem-independent proof strategies. We evaluate DafnyPro using Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7 on four benchmarks:...

RRAM based in memory computing suffers from scalability limitations due to device non idealities and fixed array sizes. Decentralized AI frameworks struggle with memory efficiency across NAT constrained networks due to static routing that ignores computational load.
