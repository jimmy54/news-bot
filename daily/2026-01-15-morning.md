- **Bridging the Trust Gap: Clinician-Validated Hybrid Explainable AI for Maternal Health Risk Assessment in Bangladesh**  
  来源：arXiv cs.AI (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.07866v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While machine learning shows promise for maternal health risk prediction, clinical adoption in resource-constrained settings faces a critical barrier: lack of explainability and trust. This study presents a hybrid explainable AI (XAI) framework combining ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, validated through systematic clinician feedback. We developed a fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, achieving 88.67% accurac...

- **Executable Ontologies in Game Development: From Algorithmic Control to Semantic World Modeling**  
  来源：arXiv cs.AI (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.07964v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper examines the application of Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework, to game development. We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior emerges naturally from declarative domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. Using a survival game scenario (Winter Feast), we demonstrate how EO achieves prioritybase...

- **Attention Consistency Regularization for Interpretable Early-Exit Neural Networks**  
  来源：arXiv cs.LG (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.08891v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Early-exit neural networks enable adaptive inference by allowing predictions at intermediate layers, reducing computational cost. However, early exits often lack interpretability and may focus on different features than deeper layers, limiting trust and explainability. This paper presents Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), a multi-objective framework that improves interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks through attention-based regu...

  来源：arXiv cs.LG (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.08893v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We introduce Spectral Generative Flow Models (SGFMs), a physics-inspired alternative to transformer-based large language models. Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.08901v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Scientific discovery is a cumulative process and requires new ideas to be situated within an ever-expanding landscape of existing knowledge. An emerging and critical challenge is how to identify conceptually relevant prior work from rapidly growing literature, and assess how a new idea differentiates from existing research. Current embedding approaches typically conflate distinct conceptual aspects into single representations and cannot support fi...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.08919v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A good deal of recent research has focused on how Large Language Models   (LLMs) may be used as `judges' in place of humans to evaluate the quality   of the output produced by various text / image processing systems. Within   this broader context, a number of studies have investigated the specific   question of how effectively LLMs can be used as relevance assessors for   the standard ad hoc task in Information Retrieval (IR). We extend these   st...

  来源：arXiv cs.SE (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.08856v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Unit tests are critical in the hardware design lifecycle to ensure that component design modules are functionally correct and conform to the specification before they are integrated at the system level. Thus developing unit tests targeting various design features requires deep understanding of the design functionality and creativity. When one or more unit tests expose a design failure, the debugging engineer needs to diagnose, localize, and debug...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.09114v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The GEneral Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) is one of the essential algorithms in scientific computing. Single-thread GEMM implementations are well-optimised with techniques like blocking and autotuning. However, due to the complexity of modern multi-core shared memory systems, it is challenging to determine the number of threads that minimises the multi-thread GEMM runtime. We present a proof-of-concept approach to building an Architecture and Data-...
