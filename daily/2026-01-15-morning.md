- **Bridging the Trust Gap: Clinician-Validated Hybrid Explainable AI for Maternal Health Risk Assessment in Bangladesh**  
  来源：arXiv cs.AI (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.07866v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While machine learning shows promise for maternal health risk prediction, clinical adoption in resource-constrained settings faces a critical barrier: lack of explainability and trust. This study presents a hybrid explainable AI (XAI) framework combining ante-hoc fuzzy logic with post-hoc SHAP explanations, validated through systematic clinician feedback. We developed a fuzzy-XGBoost model on 1,014 maternal health records, achieving 88.67% accurac...

  来源：arXiv cs.AI (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.07964v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper examines the application of Executable Ontologies (EO), implemented through the boldsea framework, to game development. We argue that EO represents a paradigm shift: a transition from algorithmic behavior programming to semantic world modeling, where agent behavior emerges naturally from declarative domain rules rather than being explicitly coded. Using a survival game scenario (Winter Feast), we demonstrate how EO achieves prioritybase...

- **Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low Rank Compression of LLM**  
  来源：arXiv cs.LG (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.07839v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) place extraordinary pressure on memory and compute budgets, making principled compression indispensable for both deployment and continued training. We present Hierarchical Sparse Plus Low-Rank (HSS) compression, a two-stage scheme that (i) removes the largest-magnitude weights into a sparse matrix S and (ii) applies a recursive Hierarchically Sparse Separable (HSS) low-rank factorisation to the dense residual ma...

- **Affect and Effect: Limitations of regularisation-based continual learning in EEG-based emotion classification**  
  来源：arXiv cs.LG (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.07858v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification remains a challenge due to high inter-and intra-subject variability. Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-bas...

  来源：arXiv cs.CL (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.07861v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically employ a traditional two-stage pipeline: an embedding model for initial retrieval followed by a reranker for refinement. However, this paradigm suffers from significant inefficiency due to the lack of shared information between stages, leading to substantial redundant computation. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{State-Centric Retrieval}, a unified retrieval paradigm that...

However, traditional summaries reflect only the authors' self-presented perspective. Analyzing how other researchers discuss and cite the paper can offer a deeper, more practical understanding of its contributions and shortcomings.

While this empowers agents to perform complex tasks, LLMs may invoke unintended tool interactions and introduce risks, such as leaking sensitive data or overwriting critical records, which are unacceptable in enterprise contexts. Current approaches to mitigate these risks,...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.08025v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is frequently hindered by their significant computational and memory requirements. While partitioning and distributing a DNN across multiple devices is a well-established strategy to mitigate this challenge, prior research has largely focused on single-objective optimization, such as minimizing latency or maximizing throughput. This paper challenges that view by ref...
