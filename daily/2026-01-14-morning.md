- **Mathematical Knowledge Graph-Driven Framework for Equation-Based Predictive and Reliable Additive Manufacturing**  
  来源：arXiv cs.AI (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.05298v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge gra...

  来源：arXiv cs.LG (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.06036v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a differentiable framework that embeds the axiomatic structure of Random Utility Models (RUM) directly into deep neural networks. Although projecting empirical choice data onto the RUM polytope is NP-hard in general, we uncover an isomorphism between RUM consistency and flow conservation on the Boolean lattice. Leveraging this combinatorial structure, we derive a novel Tree-Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver. By exploit...

  来源：arXiv cs.LG (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.06042v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: While accurate traffic forecasting is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), effectively communicating predicted conditions via natural language for human-centric decision support remains a challenge and is often handled separately. To address this, we propose CrossTrafficLLM, a novel GenAI-driven framework that simultaneously predicts future spatiotemporal traffic states and generates corresponding natural language descriptions, spec...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.06389v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Late-interaction retrieval models like ColBERT achieve superior accuracy by enabling token-level interactions, but their computational cost hinders scalability and integration with Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS). We introduce FastLane, a novel retrieval framework that dynamically routes queries to their most informative representations, eliminating redundant token comparisons. FastLane employs a learnable routing mechanism optimized al...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.06458v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential for usage in sequential recommendation tasks through text-only models, which combine advanced prompt design, contrastive alignment, and fine-tuning on downstream domain-specific data. While effective, these approaches overlook the rich visual information present in many real-world recommendation scenarios, particularly in e-commerce. This paper proposes PixRec - a vision-language fr...

  来源：arXiv cs.CL (arXiv（论文摘要）)  
  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.06037v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at many NLP tasks but struggle to sustain long-term interactions due to limited attention over extended dialogue histories. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue but lacks reliable mechanisms for updating or refining stored memories, leading to schema-driven hallucinations, inefficient write operations, and minimal support for multimodal reasoning.To address these challenges, we propose TeleMe...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.06039v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern roleplaying models are increasingly sophisticated, yet they consistently struggle to capture the essence of believable, engaging characters. We argue this failure stems from training paradigms that overlook the dynamic interplay of a character's internal world. Current approaches, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fact-based priming, literature-based learning, and synthetic data generation, exhibit recurring limitations in mod...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.06034v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Software testing is critical in the software development lifecycle, yet translating requirements into executable test scripts remains manual and error-prone. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code, they often hallucinate non-existent UI elements. We present the Autonomous QA Agent, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that grounds Selenium script generation in project-specific documentation and HTML structure. By ingesting d...

  摘要（RSS摘要）：arXiv:2601.06164v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Procurement and inventory planning is governed not only by demand forecasts and bills of materials (BOMs), but also by operational terms in contracts and supplier documents (e.g., MOQs, lead times, price tiers, allocation caps, substitution approvals). LLM-based extraction can speed up structuring these terms, but extraction-only or LLM-only decision pipelines are brittle: missed clauses, unit errors, and unresolved conflicts can yield infeasible...

However, current architectures rarely achieve a simultaneous balance of peak efficiency, architectural simplicity, and native support for ordered operations. Conventional host-centric frameworks are restricted by kernel-space network stacks and internal bus latencies. While hash-based alternatives tha...
