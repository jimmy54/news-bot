## 📝 今日总结

今日AI领域核心趋势聚焦于**智能体安全与规模化应用**。OpenAI正通过强化学习驱动的自动化红队测试，持续加固ChatGPT Atlas的提示注入防御，并推出思维链监控框架以提升AI系统可控性。同时，**AI智能体技术正加速落地**，Google研究探索LLM作为世界模型训练智能体，GitHub则总结WRAP方法论以提升Copilot编码代理的工程效率。

值得关注的研究方向包括：1）**RAG系统规模化实践**，业界开始总结生产环境部署经验；2）**LLM能力增强新路径**，MIT等机构探索模型能力扩展方法；3）**AI安全前沿防御**，从输出监控转向内部推理过程监控的新范式。

展望2025年，AI技术正从模型创新转向**系统化工程部署与安全加固**阶段。企业级应用加速渗透（OpenAI客户超百万），但浏览器智能体的安全风险研究也提示需建立更完善的Agent安全评估体系。开源安全（如OSS-Fuzz持续模糊测试）与供应链防护将成为基础设施的重要组成部分。

  来源：Rust Blog (博客)  
  摘要（全文）：Rust has been named Stack Overflow's Most Loved (now called Most Admired) language every year since our 1.0 release in 2015. That means people who use Rust want to keep using Rust1--and not just for performance-heavy stuff or embedded development, but for shell scripts, web apps, and all kinds of things you wouldn't expect. One of our participants captured it well when they said, "At this point, I don't want to write code in any other language but Rust." When we sat down to crunch the vision doc...
